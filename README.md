# Wicked Salez

https://wicked-sales.jonathanlo.dev

Wicked Salez is a pretend online storefront that offers the full CRUD experience. It was made to showcase my front end ability using React and my back end utilizing PHP and MySQL. 

### Features 
- Users can add, delete, and update the quantity of products in their cart.
- Utilizes sessions so that their cart persists through refreshes and React Router so that the page maintains the state depending on the url. 
- Calculates tax and shipping costs depending on how fast user wishes to receive their purchase and accounts for weekend shipping. 
- Can checkout their cart and will save their order in the database while also wiping their cart. 

### Future Additions
- Implement promo code field for special discounts or general easter eggs.
- Ability to add reviews if user "owns" the product
    -need to add cron jobs to periodically wipe in case of inappropriate comments
- Admin access to be able to add/edit products in website as opposed to directly modifying database
-Hero Page? Not sure if necessary. Maybe rotate a featured game and add a discount to it every couple days?

### Technology

Created with Javascript, React.js, Axios, React Router, React Modal, Bootstrap 4, CSS, HTML5, MySQL, and PHP. 

### Setup 

To be added.
